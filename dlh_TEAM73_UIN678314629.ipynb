    "#### Summary and Critical Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The DuETT model is purported to be the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for the MIMIC-IV 2.0 and PhysioNet-2012 datasets in terms of mortality prediction and phenotype classification tasks. The authors have made the source code for the DuETT model, along with the training and evaluation pipelines for PhysioNet-2012, publicly available. However, due to certain reasons, the pipeline for MIMIC-IV 2.0 is not provided, posing challenges for reproducibility. Additionally, the training and evaluation code for the MIMIC-IV dataset has not been provided, despite the authors' claim of their model's strong generalizability. \n",
    "\n",
    "I deliberately avoided requesting code or details from the authors that were not disclosed initially, focusing instead on determining the true factors influencing the final performance through my own trial runs. A pertinent question arises: Did the authors exert the same level of effort in feature inclusion (85 chart event variables and 29 lab event variables added for ICU mortality) and processing when comparing their model to other approaches, such as XGBoost? Without comprehensive and equivalent feature handling, it becomes difficult to assert that the DuETT model is unequivocally superior to other methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the data processing for PhysioNet-2012 is relatively straightforward and standardized, integrating with the torchtime.data library, the situation is less clear for the MIMIC-IV benchmark. The paper's methodology is based on an implementation from MIMIC-III but includes additional features and engineering, which complicates the process of benchmarking. __Based on the sparse information from the paper, a considerable amount of my time was dedicated to developing a data pipeline for MIMIC-IV 2.0, which involved modifying 14 files with 500 lines of code added and 69 lines removed. Furthermore, I worked on the training and evaluation code for MIMIC-IV 2.0, adding 2 files with 405 lines of code.__ Throughout the process, a significant portion of the time was dedicated to fine-tuning the hyperparameters. This was essential to enhance the initial performance and to narrow the gap between my results and the data presented in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "__In my comprehensive evaluation, I have been able to replicate results that are on par with those reported in the paper for both datasets. However, my critical assessment leads me to conclude that Data/Feature Engineering and Hyper-parameter optimization are paramount, particularly for this hyper-sparse and medium-sized dataset. The impact of deviating from these critical steps on performance is far more substantial than any variations in the model architecture itself.__\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper's pioneering use of DuETT's 2D transformer architecture on the MIMIC-IV 2.0 and PhysioNet-2012 datasets, coupled with the SSL/Pretrain/Fine-tune methodology, represents a significant innovation at the time of its publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, __Thank you, Professor Sun and the teaching team__, for an enlightening journey through the Deep Learning for Healthcare course, which has been a pivotal and rewarding experience as I complete my Master of Computer Science at UIUC.\n"

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background of the problem\n",
    "1. What type of problem: The problem addressed in the paper revolves around the effective modeling and analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHR) data for various clinical predictions and insights. Specifically, the paper focuses on the development of a machine learning model capable of handling the unique challenges posed by EHR data, such as high sparsity, irregular observations, and the need to leverage the temporal and event-type dimensions for accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Importance/Meaning of solving the problem: Solving this problem is crucial for improving patient care and hospital operations. Accurate predictions based on EHR data can lead to timely interventions, reduced readmissions, and better management of healthcare resources. Moreover, understanding the structure and patterns within EHR data can provide valuable insights into patient health trends and inform clinical decision-making processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Difficulty of the problem: The complexity of EHR data, characterized by its high-dimensionality, sparsity, and irregularity, presents significant challenges for traditional time series analysis methods. The need for a model that can effectively capture the relationships between different types of observations and the temporal dynamics of patient health adds to the difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. State of the art methods and effectiveness: Prior to the proposed method, various neural network models, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and gradient boosting models like XGBoost, have been applied to EHR data with varying degrees of success. However, these models often struggle to fully exploit the structured relationships within the data, especially when it comes to multivariate time series with missing values.\n",
    "## Paper explanation\n",
    "1. What did the paper propose: The paper introduces DuETT (Dual Event Time Transformer), a novel architecture that extends the capabilities of Transformers to handle both time and event type dimensions in EHR data. DuETT is designed to provide robust representations from EHR data by transforming sparse time series into a regular sequence with fixed length, thus reducing computational complexity and enabling the use of larger and deeper neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Innovations of the method: The key innovations of DuETT include its ability to attend over both time and event type dimensions, the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) for model pre-training, and the design of an input representation that incorporates event information, static variables, and aggregates observations in a way that is computationally efficient. The paper also proposes a novel SSL training scheme that performs masked modeling of measured time/event values and missingness across both dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How well the proposed method works (in its own metrics): The proposed DuETT model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models on multiple downstream tasks from the MIMIC-IV and PhysioNet-2012 EHR datasets. It demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as mortality prediction and phenotype classification, showcasing its effectiveness in learning from EHR data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Contribution to the research regime: As stated in the paper, the authors believe that their core contributions are:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    (1) the novel DuETT architecture design, which extends Transformers to exploit both time and event modalities of EHR data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (2) The design of input representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (3) A novel self-supervised training scheme that performs masked modelling of measured event values and missingness across both time and event dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (4) A thorough empirical evaluation of the approach on the MIMIC-IV (Johnson et al., 2022) and PhysioNet-2012 (Silva et al., 2012) hospital EHR datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances (beating XGBoost specifically).\n",
    "NOTE: This paper primarily focuses on the classification and prediction of event values within the modeling framework, not addressing the time-to-event forecasting aspect, which is a popular research topic and application area using similar datasets. Additionally, the scope of this study is restricted to numeric data inputs; it does not capitalize on the potential of textual data and other diverse data modalities.\n",

    "# Scope of Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The DuETT model can be sufficiently and accurately replicated to reproduce the original results, thereby validating its effectiveness in handling the complexities of EHR data. The goal is to achieve a comparable level of performance, thereby substantiating its status as state-of-the-art.\n",
    "    Owing to constrained computational resources and time, the following components will be addressed.\n",
    "    - MIMIC-IV 2.0 ICU Mortality Task\n",
    "    - PhysioNet-2012 Mortaliy\n",
    "    - Excluding:\n",
    "        - MIMIC-IV ED Transfer to ICU task\n",
    "        - MIMIC-IV ICU Phenotyping\n",
    "          \n",
    "3. The outcomes of the ablation study should correspond with the findings\n",
    "reported in the paper. Ablations to be covered (progressing, till end of project):\n",
    "    - Attention Mechanisms: Due to limitations in time and resources, this project will focus on replicating the \"Time Transformer only\" experiment, which\n",
    "experienced the most significant decrease in performance.\n",
    "    - Self-Supervised Learning: Due to limitations in time and resources, this project will focus on replicating the \"Event type masking only\" experiment, which experienced the most significant decrease in performance. Note: This suggests that there is potential for enhancing the current masking approach, particularly along the time dimension, which could lead to a boost in the model's overall performance.\n",
    "    - The remaining ablation studies presented in the paper are logical and align with expectations; however, due to constraints in time and resources, they will not be verified as part of this project.\n",

    "```\n",
    "The overall structure of our DuETT model is a series of DuETT layers followed by classification or self-supervised learning heads. Each DuETT layer is made up of two Transformer sublayers that attend along the event and time dimensions respectively. The first sublayer consists of multi-head attention over events followed by a feed-forward network operating along the event dimension, which can be collectively identified as an event transformer layer; the second sublayer consists of multi-head attention over time bins followed by a feed-forward network operating along the time dimension, the time transformer layer. The dual attention architecture enables our model to capture the two important modalities of EHR data, namely the types of events that are observed for a given patient and the times at which they are observed. Event-type and time bin embeddings are injected just before their respective sublayers. Embedding injections are done throughout the entire network, rather than just before the first layer, to ensure access and to emphasize the ordering information of data, especially in upper layers.\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Layer Number/Size/Type**: DuETT model uses 2 DuETT layers, with a total of 4 Transformer sublayers. The Transformers have an internal feedforward dimension of 512. The classification head has one hidden layer of size 64 and batch normalization after the hidden layer. The static data encoder has one hidden layer of size 128 and batch normalization after the hidden layer. The implementation uses 32 time steps.\n",

    "##### 2. Discuss with respect to the hypothesis and results from the original paper\n",
    "- The results for the PhysioNet-2012 dataset have been successfully replicated without any inconsistencies.\n",
    "- The MIMIC-IV ICU Mortality task has seen significant improvement due to careful feature engineering and hyperparams adjustments. The AUROC has increased from __0.82 to 0.858(draft submission) to 0.8923(final submission)__ as I have progressively implemented and corrected further details in accordance with the paper and my own discoveries.\n",
    "- For the MIMIC-IV ICU Mortality task, focusing on feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning (both are not fully disclosed in the original paper) is key to refining the model's performance, assuming that the model implementation from the paper is accurate.\n",
    "- As per plan, given the limitations in resources and time, I have intentionally chosen not to conduct experiments on the MIMIC-IV Phenotyping and MIMIC-IV ED datasets.\n",
    "## 3. Experiments beyond the original paper\n",
    "- Given the hyper-sparse nature of the input matrix, I have conducted extensive experiments to determine the optimal hyperparameters listed below. These parameters not only prove effective but also perform exceptionally well under minimal assumptions regarding further consolidation or data cleaning after adding features per the original paper:\n",
    "    - Pre-train Phase: pretrain_dropout=0.95\n",
    "    - Fine-tuning Phase: aug_noise=0.05, aug_mask=0.6, transformer_dropout=0.6,lr=5.e-5, weight_decay=1.e-5r\n",
    "## 4. Ablation Study\n",
    "![](https://uiuc-dlh.s3.amazonaws.com/duett_ablations.png)\n",
    "- Through experiments on the above planned ablation study\n",
    "    - The delta (drop) for Time Transformer Only is 0.025 vs original 0.04. \n",
    "    - The delta (drop) for Event Type Masking Only is 0.036 vs original 0.05.\n",
    "    - Disclaimer: Due to limited resources, I am unable to perform multiple runs of the experiment, which restricts the ability to provide a comprehensive statistical range.. \n",
    "    - Conclusion: These results are consistent with the findings of the original paper and are logically sound. It can be inferred that the removal of either the Event Transformer or the Time bin masking feature has a relatively significant negative impact on the model's performance.\n"

    "# Discussion\n",
    "## 1. Implications of the experimental results, whether the original paper was reproducible\n",
    "- __PhysioNet-2012: On-par | Maintain SOTA Position__\n",
    "  - The PhysioNet-2012 benchmark proved readily reproducible, aligning with published findings. This success can be attributed to the standardized approach to data processing and feature engineering.\n",
    "- __MIMIC IV 2.0 (ICU Mortality Task): On-par | Maintain SOTA Position__ (NOTE: Confident in the potential to surpass current benchmarks through ongoing enhancements in feature engineering and hyper-parameter tuning)\n",
    "  - Achieving comparable results for the MIMIC IV 2.0 (ICU Mortality Task) required significant effort in refining the data/feature pipeline and hyperparameter tuning. The lack of original code and unspecified methodological details posed challenges.\n",
    "## 2. What was easy\n",
    "- The PhysioNet-2012 task was straightforward, necessitating no alterations to the code, data pipeline, or hyperparameters.\n",
    "- For MIMIC IV 2.0, the duett.py containing the model architecture was robust and required no modification. However, hyperparameter adjustments were essential based on different feature engineering outputs.\n",
    "## 3. What was difficult\n",
    "- The absence of MIMIC IV 2.0 data processing code, along with its unclarified description in the paper, made replicating the exact data filtering logic for the benchmark test particularly difficult.\n",
    "- The original paper's reliance on benchmark code designed for the MIMIC III dataset, without accompanying code or a standard reference, further complicated matters.\n",
    "- Clarity on data generation for the ICU Mortality Task was obscured by inconsistencies in item_id and variable names, as well as ambiguities in imputation, filtering, and consolidation processes.\n",
    "- The specificity of feature engineering, particularly the consolidation of features from Harutyunyan et al. (2019), influenced the sparsity of the generated data, significantly affecting hyperparameter tuning, such as the pretrain_dropout parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "My experiments indicated that these factors had a more pronounced impact on performance than the core DuETT model architecture's hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, The computational intensity of the tasks led to a substantial increase in experimental costs, limiting the scope of verification and tuning to partial due to a budget of approximately 800 USD.\n",
    "## 4. Recommendations to the original authors or others who work in this area for improving reproducibility\n",
    "- I recommend that the original authors release the data pipeline for MIMIC IV 2.0 and its ICU Mortality Task to facilitate future research.\n",
    "- It is suggested to rigorously challenge the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance through fine-tuning of established GBT methods like XGBoost and LightGBM. These approaches may offer stronger competition in the tabular time-series domain when paired with thorough feature engineering, despite the allure of novel architectures for academic research.\n",
    "- It is crucial to critically assess and comment on the validity of benchmark results when custom dataset filtering logics are applied. For instance, the inclusion of patients with multiple ICU stays in the training/test set, without incorporating all their ICU stays, deviates from the original MIMIC III benchmark by Harutyunyan et al. (2019). Such customizations can markedly alter the data input assumptions and distribution for other SOTA approaches.\n"
